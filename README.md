# Web-scraping-Yelp-reviews
Analyze sentiments about a restaurant by scraping Yelp.com


Hello,

In this project I have attempted to gather sentiments about an entity hosted on Yelp.com . Yelp.com is a popular review sites and seems like a good starting point for web-scraping efforts.

I have used python exclusively for scraping, cleaning and presenting/ visualizing the results.

The file is an ipython notebook.

Following python packages are used in this project:

1. urllib2 : for gathering url contents
2. beautifulsoup: for parsing HTML
3. pandas : for data processing
4. wordcloud: for creating wordclouds from the review text


The sample code is for an Indian restaurant, however, any other entity can be selected by changing the URL
